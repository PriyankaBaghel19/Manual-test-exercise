**Verify Addresser details.****

**Steps to reproduce -**
1- Open Addresser.exe file
2- Open Exported_contacts.txt file
3- Compare Addresser.exe file with Exported_contacts.txt file 


**Current behaviour (bug)-**

please find below observations -

1. For Addresser John Doe - Phone number is missing in Exported_contacts.txt file whereas In Addresser.exe phone number (+34 657345261) is present.

2. The order of records are not in sync. I can see first record in Addresser.exe file is Jane Doe whereas In Exported_contacts.txt file , John Doe is first record.

3. In Addresser.exe , I can see there are only two records are present but In Exported_contacts.txt file , 9 records are present

4. For extra records which are only present in Exported_contacts.txt file, all coloums are not having correct values.

**Expected behaviour-
**
- There should be equal number of records in Exported_contacts.txt file and Addresser.exe 
- Exported_contacts.txt records should have same value as Addresser.exe
